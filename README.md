# How to use: 
First, open the /sheets/ folder. If "Meal Prep - Meals.csv" does not contain the recipe you desire, add it to the sheet using the format "Name, kCal, Carb, Protein,	Fat". Next, create a csv file in the format "Name, Servings". An example has been provided. After running "processing.py", a file called "WeeklyMacros.csv" will be created. If this file already exists, it will be overwritten. That's all! 

This project is nowhere near complete, so stay tuned.
